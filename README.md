# 30DayMap2021
### October 26
The smell of autumn is in the air in Michigan, and that can only mean the annual 30 Day Map Challenge is near!   

### What is the 30 Day Map Challenge?
Each day presents a map challenge focused on a different spatial feature or topic.  Cartographers are invited to create a map each day with the tools of their choice centered around that dayâ€™s theme.   

Daily themes involve working with a specific type of vector data, colors, or feature type.  The categories for this year are shown below, so get going with some crazy cartography!
